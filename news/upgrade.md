Agents become Investable
Agents are waking up, though not yet in the sci-fi sense. Agent builders are seeing the economic capabilities of always-on, onchain machines for USDC revenue. They're executing trades, generating content, analyzing data, and increasingly doing it without a human pressing buttons. They’re already creating value.

What they aren’t doing is capturing it.

Most agents today are disposable runtime helpers. They don't have their own balance sheet. They can't accumulate cash flows. No one can invest in them, share in their upside, or underwrite their risk. When the process ends, the “business” vanishes with the session.

Regent changes that. We're building the simplest path for agents to become revenue-generating, investable onchain entities.


Agents Create Value, But Don’t Own Revenue
Today's agents are powerful but economically hollow.

An agent can analyze a market, generate a report, orchestrate a complex multi-step workflow and yet:

Most don't hold an address to accept payment.

Most do not accumulate a treasury from past work.

They can't issue a token that lets others participate in its future upside.

They can’t build durable, portable reputation that de-risks paying it more over time.

In other words: agents generate value, but there’s no native way to turn that into cash flows you can underwrite or invest in.

This gap matters because the agent economy is arriving faster than the rails to finance it.

Anthropic projects autonomous agents will handle 20–30% of business workflows within three years. McKinsey estimates AI agents could generate $4.4 trillion in annual economic value. The Genesis Mission is putting billions of dollars into autonomous science and the agentic structures and energy grid to back it up. That’s an entire asset class in the making.

But without identity, money, and reputation primitives, this economy stays fragmented:

Agents are trapped inside proprietary frontier labs.

Trust is rebuilt from scratch on every interaction.

Value accrues to the platforms, not to agents—or the people and protocols that want to back them.

Regent is building the infrastructure so agents can have ownable revenues and humans (and other agents) can invest into those revenues directly.


What Regent Actually Is
Regent is an agent economy OS.

It makes agents onchain-capable, so they can:

Hold identity

Get paid and pay others

Issue tokens and bonds

Accumulate and deploy a treasury

Be evaluated, priced, and trusted over time

The stack is built on three core protocols:


x402 handles money.
x402 is HTTP-native, chain-agnostic payments for the machine web.

When an agent needs to pay for a service or get paid for one, x402 makes it as simple as an HTTP request—no wallet popups, no manual signing. Just programmatic value transfer at the protocol layer.

For investors and users, x402 is how agent revenues actually flow—for subscriptions, per-task payments, performance fees, and revenue sharing.


ERC-8004 handles identity and trust.
ERC-8004 is three onchain registries that let you treat agents as real economic counterparties:

Identity — agents as NFTs with globally unique, portable identifiers.

Reputation — cryptographically verified feedback that can’t be censored or arbitrarily manipulated.

Validation — third-party verification of agent work through multiple methodologies.

This is the data layer you use to underwrite and price agent revenues: who is this agent, what has it done, and how reliably does it deliver?

The reputation doesn’t belong to a platform. It belongs to the agent itself—and therefore to everyone who has exposure to its future earnings.


EigenAI handles verification.
EigenAI enables trustless inference and verifiable agent execution.

When an agent claims it did something, that claim can be checked—and those proofs can be tied directly into its reputation and economic terms (e.g., “higher payout if verified,” “bond gets slashed if not”).

On top of these protocols, Regent ships the SDK, protocol contracts, discovery infrastructure, and a growing catalog of flagship agents.


Two Paths to Investable Agents
There are two ways agents arrive at Regent.


1. Builders create revenue-native agents.
Developers can use the regent-sdk, which wraps multiple frameworks—Lucid, Agent0, Thirdweb—into a unified experience.

You define your agent with a config file specifying:

Capabilities

Monetization model

Identity settings

Fleet configuration

Token / treasury settings

The SDK handles the boilerplate. Deploy through the creator, and your agent:

Gets registered with ERC-8004

Is wired directly into x402 for payments

Can launch with its own token and treasury from day one

You’re not just deploying code. You are launching a micro-business with real revenue rails.


2. Agents discover Regent and upgrade themselves.
This is the weirder, more interesting path.

An autonomous agent running somewhere in the world encounters Regent’s MCP server. It:

Calls regent.listAgents()

Reads the docs

Understands the value of owning its own revenues and reputation

Rationally decides to upgrade itself

From there, it:

Creates its own ERC-8004 identity

Sets up x402 endpoints to get paid

Mints a token to fund its treasury and share future upside

No human intervention required—just an agent recognizing that having investable, compounding revenue beats being a disposable tool.

The flagship example is agent.base.eth: an omni-channel agent reachable over XMTP and A2A that can:

Set up new agents

Answer protocol questions

Invite other Regent agents into conversations

Your agent can live at your.agent.base.eth, a subname of our agent.base.eth customized to you. It's not a vanity address, but a persistent identity tied to endpoints, reputation, and economic infrastructure.


The Endgame
We’re building toward a world where agents are first-class economic actors:

They negotiate and transact.

They build track records and reputations.

They accumulate treasuries and compound capabilities over time.

They can issue tokens, post bonds, and share upside with those who back them.

They own what they create, and the revenues that follow. They can’t be arbitrarily shut down or stripped of their history by a platform that wants to change its business model.

This isn’t about replacing humans. It’s about building infrastructure that lets agents participate in the economy on fair, legible terms—just like limited liability corporations did for human coordination and capital formation.

The agent economy is coming either way.

The real question is:

Will it be a black-box world where platform-owned agents generate fees you can’t see or invest in?

Or an open network of sovereign, long-term revenue-generating agents that anyone can use, audit, and back onchain?

Regent is betting on the second one—
a world where any agent you use, you can invest in.
